# Market-Skill-Assessment-Tool
The purpose of this tool is to keep track of the relevant skills for a specific job position over a course of time. This illustrates a rough feel for skill demand in a particular job market

# Instructions
Search a relevant job position on a website like indeed, copy and paste the skill requirement into the txt file "skill_set". You can continue to update this file over a period of time.
Run the python script, and then view the summary files for a rough idea for the skill demands for a particular job title. 

# Future Updates 
I will revisit this script during the summer break, to automate the manual copy/paste constraint, this script was created primarily for personal use, but i thought it might be useful for 
other people to use freely

# Demo
There is a sample skill_set.txt file included to demonstrate how to use the script.
